# Youtube Trends

YouTube is a gigantic video-sharing platform based in San Bruno, California that earned a revenue of $15 billion in 2019. Due to the vast number of published videos, it is difficult to understand which categories, channels, or videos themselves are the most popular over time. It would seem reasonable that stakeholders in YouTube would like to understand what is trending and how their users interact with these videos. Is there a connection between the number of views, likes, dislikes, and comments on a given video? Is there a reason that certain video categories perform signifcantly better than other categories? Is it possible to predict user behavior over time? If these factors are known, it would be benefical for not only the executives/stakeholders, but the creators themselves to be able to predict success or failure. 

This repository consists of analysis performed on various YouTube datasets and includes observable trends. The data includes the Top US Trending Videos from Kaggle for August to November of 2020. It also includes three datasets from YouTube API: YouTube Search Items, YouTube Video Statistics, and Youtube Channel Statistics. This repository includes trend analysis on user behavior, video statistics, channel statistics, and category statisics from 2019 and 2020. It also provides insights during the strict Covid Lockdown in the US from March to June 2020.
